# Artificial-intelligence

Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. One of the most used language for the development is Python. 

In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.

This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.

Here are the few Advantages and DIsadvantages of AI.
##Advantages

Good at detail-oriented jobs;
Reduced time for data-heavy tasks;
Delivers consistent results; and
AI-powered virtual agents are always available.


##Disadvantages

Expensive;
Requires deep technical expertise;
Limited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools;
Only knows what it's been shown; and
Lack of ability to generalize from one task to another.

Also, lets see more about the difference between Strong AI and a Weak AI.
